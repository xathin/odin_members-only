# Members Only app

This app is part of the **Ruby on Rails** cirriculum at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication?ref=lnav).

## Information

This site is part of the authentication for **Ruby on Rails**. Registered members can write *"embarrassing"* posts about non-members. Inside, members are able to see who the author is, but from outside the information is hidden. This is a "roll your own" authentication system.
